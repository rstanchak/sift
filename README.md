In the fall of 2004 I wrote a C++ implementation of David Lowe's Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. I utilized OpenCV for the image data structures and some of the low level image processing. The code relies heavily on C++ classes and templates so a reasonably up to date compiler is required (VC 7.0 and gcc 3.0). This code is no longer maintained.
